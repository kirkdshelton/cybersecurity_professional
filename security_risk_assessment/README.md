<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers&rsquo; personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">After inspecting the organization&rsquo;s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The organization&rsquo;s employees&#39; share passwords.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The admin password for the database is set to the default.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">The folowing is a security risk assessment analyzing the incident and explaining what methods could be used to further secure the network.</span></span></p>

<h1><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Security Risk Assessment&nbsp;</span></h1>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Goal: To find ways to make the social media organization&#39;s network safer after a data breach, with their customers&#39; personal information being stolen.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">I found four big problems with their network:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Problem: Employees share passwords.<br />
	Risk: This makes it easier for the wrong people to get into the system and see private things.<br />
	Solution:&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">Everyone needs their own secret password that is strong and not easy to guess.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">The organization should teach employees about keeping passwords private and not sharing them.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They can use a special tool to help remember passwords and keep them safe.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Problem: The main password for the important database is still the default one.<br />
	Risk: This means that it&#39;s easy for&nbsp;people with bad intentions to get into the database and do bad things.<br />
	Solution: T</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">hey need to change the default password right away to a strong and secret one.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They should regularly change this password to keep it safe.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They can use a special system to manage important passwords and make sure they are strong and secure.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Problem: The firewalls don&#39;t have rules to stop bad internet traffic.<br />
	Risk: This means that malicious people can easily get into the network and do bad things.<br />
	Solution:&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They should set up special rules on the firewalls to only allow good and necessary internet traffic.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They can use a special system that helps detect and stop bad traffic from coming in.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They need to keep the firewalls up to date with the latest security fixes.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Problem: They don&#39;t use extra steps to log in, like a fingerprint or a special code.<br />
	Risk: This means that it&#39;s easier for individuals with malicious intent to get into someone&#39;s account without permission.<br />
	Solution:&nbsp;</span></span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They should make it so that when people log in, they need to do something extra, like using their fingerprint or a special code.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">The organization needs to teach everyone about this and help them set it up.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif; font-size:16px">They should always check that everyone is using this extra step when they log in.</span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">Extra Recommendations:</span></span></p>

<ol style="margin-left:40px">
	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">They should regularly check for problems and fix them quickly.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">They need to have a plan ready in case an incident&nbsp;happens again.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">They should teach everyone about how to be safe online and protect themselves.</span></span></li>
	<li><span style="font-size:16px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif">They need to make sure that important information is kept secret by using special codes.</span></span></li>
</ol>
