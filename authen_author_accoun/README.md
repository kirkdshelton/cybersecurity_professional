<h2>Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting Exercise</h2>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">You&rsquo;re the first cybersecurity professional hired by a growing business.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Recently, a deposit was made from the business to an unknown bank account. The finance manager says they didn&rsquo;t make a mistake. Fortunately, they were able to stop the payment. The owner has asked you to investigate what happened to prevent any future incidents.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">To do this, you&rsquo;ll need to do some accounting on the incident to better understand what happened. First, you will review the access log of the incident. Next, you will take notes that can help you identify a possible threat actor. Then, you will spot issues with the access controls that were exploited by the user. Finally, you will recommend mitigations that can improve the business&#39; access controls and reduce the likelihood that this incident reoccurs.</span></span></p>

			Someone from the Legal Department. Upon further investigation, by looking at the employee directory, the employee that did this was Robert Taylor (Contract Employee)<br />
			It occurred at : 8:29:57 AM on 10/03/2023 (last time he accessed).<br />

			<p><strong>Objective: Make at least 1 recommendation that could prevent this kind of incident:</strong><br />
			In the future, the principle of least privilege should be applied. As a contract employee, he should have not received Admin Access.<br />

			Separation of duties should also have been applied. A contract employee that worked in the Legal Department should not have access to payroll disbursements and banking information.</p>
