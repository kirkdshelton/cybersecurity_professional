<h2>Pyramid of Pain</h2>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">You are a level one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. You have received an alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee&#39;s computer.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">You investigate this alert and discover that the employee received an email containing an attachment. The attachment was a password-protected spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet&#39;s password was provided in the email. The employee downloaded the file, then entered the password to open the file. When the employee opened the file, a malicious payload was then executed on their computer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">You retrieve the malicious file and create a SHA256 hash of the file. You might recall from a previous course that a <strong>hash function</strong> is an algorithm that produces a code that can&#39;t be decrypted. Hashing is a cryptographic method used to uniquely identify malware, acting as the file&#39;s unique fingerprint.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><span style="font-family:'Google Sans',sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Has this file hash been reported as malicious? Explain why or why not.</span></span></h3>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">After conducting an extensive examination, it has come to our attention that the file hash in question has been flagged as malicious by a substantial number of reputable vendors, surpassing the count of 50. Delving deeper into our analysis, we have determined that this particular file hash corresponds to the notorious malware known as Flagpro, a malicious software frequently employed by the advanced threat actor group known as BlackTech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Flagpro, as a form of malware, exhibits a wide range of sophisticated techniques that enable it to infiltrate and compromise targeted systems. Its deployment has been observed in numerous high-profile cyber attacks, often resulting in significant breaches and extensive damage to the affected entities. The utilization of this file hash by the BlackTech threat actor group serves as a strong indication of their involvement and highlights the gravity of the situation at hand.</span></p>
