<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">Hello, my name is Kirk D. Shelton. I am very passionate about cybersecurity, compliance, and protecting people&#39;s privacy rights. I have strong organizational skills and can quickly learn and adapt to new systems and processes. This helps me make valuable contributions to organizations and the people they serve.</span></span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#ffffff"><span style="background-color:#000000">About This Git&nbsp;</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:16px">This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of diverse projects that have been successfully accomplished during my studies with the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate Program. It offers viewers a tangible demonstration of my competencies and capabilities within a professional setting, providing valuable insights into my potential contributions within a work environment.</span></span></p>

<p>Having personally experienced the distressing consequences of identity theft, my interest in security and risk management, specifically within the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) framework, has grown significantly. Being a victim of identity theft made me realize the critical importance of protecting sensitive information, especially payment card data. I understand the potential harm and the impact it can have on individuals and businesses. By delving into security and risk management, particularly within the PCI-DSS realm, I aim to enhance my knowledge and skills to better protect myself and others from such malicious activities. I want to contribute to creating secure environments where businesses can handle payment card data with the utmost care, ensuring the trust and confidence of their customers.</>

<p><p>I am also drawn to the role of a SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst because I have a deep passion for solving complex problems and creating effective solutions. As a SOC analyst, I would have the opportunity to tackle intricate cybersecurity challenges on a daily basis. I enjoy the thrill of investigating and analyzing security incidents, uncovering their root causes, and devising strategies to mitigate them. The dynamic nature of the job, where no two days are the same, appeals to my problem-solving nature. I find satisfaction in being able to contribute to the overall security posture of an organization by proactively identifying and addressing potential threats. Becoming a SOC analyst would allow me to leverage my analytical mindset, attention to detail, and determination to develop innovative solutions that safeguard valuable assets and ensure the protection of sensitive information.</p>
